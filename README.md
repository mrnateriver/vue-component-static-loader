# vue-component-static-loader

> Webpack loader for ES/TS Vue [class components](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component) that statically parses decorator options and transforms them in a way that mimics [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) SFC behaviour, but without **.vue** files.

**TODO** NPM badge.

### Usage

**TODO** Describe how to use loader itself and the forked vue-class-component decorator at runtime. 

### Example

**TODO** Provide an example of a Webpack configuration and a component class.

### How does it work

**TODO** Describe the process of rewriting source files.

### Caveats and TODOs
